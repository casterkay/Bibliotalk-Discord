# Research: YouTube → EverMemOS → Discord Figure Bots

**Phase 0 output for:** `003-discord-bot`
**Date:** 2026-03-07
**Resolves all NEEDS CLARIFICATION items from Technical Context in plan.md**

## 1. YouTube Discovery — yt-dlp Flat Extraction

**Decision:** Use `yt-dlp --flat-playlist --dump-single-json {url}` to list channel or playlist entries without video downloads. Parse the `entries` array for `id`, `title`, `url`, `upload_date`, and `channel` fields. Compare against the `last_seen_video_id` cursor stored in `ingest_state` to compute the delta on each poll.

**Rationale:** Already proven in this codebase — `youtube_transcript.py` already shells out to `yt-dlp` for per-video metadata. Flat extraction avoids any video download; it returns structured JSON per playlist item and works for both channel URLs and playlist URLs without an API key. The `upload_date` field (`YYYYMMDD` string) combined with `last_published_at` cursor enables reliable incrementality.

**Alternatives considered:**
- YouTube Data API v3: requires API key, has daily quota. Rejected.
- RSS (YouTube channel feed): available as the `rss_feed.py` fallback path already in the repository; keep wired as FR-015 optional fallback when yt-dlp flat extraction fails for a given source; not the primary path.

## 2. SQLAlchemy 2.x Async with aiosqlite

**Decision:** Use `create_async_engine("sqlite+aiosqlite:///{db_path}")` with `async_sessionmaker(expire_on_commit=False)` and `DeclarativeBase`. Migrations via Alembic using the `run_sync` pattern (`await conn.run_sync(Base.metadata.create_all)` for tests; `alembic upgrade head` for production). All three packages reference the same DB path via `BIBLIOTALK_DB_PATH` environment variable.

**Rationale:** Operator directive. SQLAlchemy 2.x async integrates cleanly with the `asyncio` event loops used by both `discord.ext.tasks` (collector polling) and `discord.py` (bot event handling). `aiosqlite` is non-blocking, preventing the Discord event loop from stalling during DB writes. `agents_service` already has an Alembic setup that can be adapted. Typed ORM models (`Mapped[T]`) prevent raw SQL query drift between the three packages sharing the same schema. `expire_on_commit=False` is the standard pattern for async sessions to avoid lazy-load errors after commit.

**Alternatives considered:**
- Raw `aiosqlite` + manual SQL: Faster to bootstrap but loses type safety, migration tooling, and the ability to run `alembic upgrade head` on deployments. Rejected per operator directive.
- Tortoise ORM: Not in the existing stack. Rejected.

## 3. discord.py 2.x — Process-Per-Bot Pattern

**Decision:** Subclass `discord.Client` (not `commands.Bot`). Override `on_ready` (start the collector polling task) and `on_message` (route DMs to the agent orchestrator). Launch with `asyncio.run(client.start(DISCORD_TOKEN))`. The collector polling loop runs as a `discord.ext.tasks.loop` task, started inside `on_ready`, sharing the same asyncio event loop as the Discord client.

**Rationale:** `discord.Client` is the minimal surface needed: receive DM events + call REST API for feed posting. `commands.Bot` adds prefix-command and slash-command machinery that is not needed and increases the attack surface. `discord.ext.tasks.loop` integrates natively with the running event loop, avoiding a second thread or subprocess for the polling loop. Each figure runs as a separate OS process, providing fault isolation: a crash in Figure A's bot does not affect Figure B.

**Alternatives considered:**
- Separate asyncio processes for bot and collector with IPC: Adds inter-process plumbing. Rejected — both the bot and collector share the same figure context and the same SQLite session factory.
- Sharded gateway: Not needed at MVP scale (2–10 bots, each low-traffic).

## 4. google-adk LlmAgent Pattern

**Decision:** Use `google.adk.agents.LlmAgent` with two registered tool functions: `memory_search` (EMOS RRF search + BM25 rerank) and `emit_citations` (inline `memory_url` link construction). The agent is instantiated once per figure at process startup with a figure-specific system prompt. Each DM turn is dispatched via `await orchestrator.run_async(message, user_id=discord_user_id)`.

**Rationale:** The existing `agent_factory.py` and `orchestrator.py` already implement this pattern for the prior Matrix runtime. `LlmAgent` handles the Gemini function-calling loop; tools are Python callables decorated with `@adk.tool`. The figure-scoped system prompt enforces the persona contract and the evidence-only response rule. The `orchestrator.py` already has the multi-turn context window logic that can be adapted.

**Alternatives considered:**
- Raw `genai.GenerativeModel.generate_content` without ADK: Requires manually implementing the function-calling loop and tool dispatch. Rejected — ADK already handles this correctly.
- LangChain: Not in the project stack. Rejected.

## 5. Transcript Batch Grouping Rules

**Decision:** Group adjacent `Segment` rows from the same `Source` into `TranscriptBatch` records using:

1. **Silence gap** (primary): If `next_segment.start_ms - current_segment.end_ms > 3_000`, start a new batch.
2. **Character limit** (secondary): If adding the next segment would make the accumulated batch text exceed **1,800 characters**, start a new batch.
3. **Speaker change** (tertiary, optional): If both segments have a non-null `speaker` field and they differ, start a new batch.

The `batch_rule` column records the trigger (`"silence_gap"`, `"char_limit"`, or `"speaker_change"`). When segments lack `start_ms`/`end_ms` (uncommon for YouTube transcripts), fall back to character-limit-only grouping.

**Rationale:** 3 s is the standard paragraph-boundary heuristic for auto-captioned speech. The 1,800-char ceiling keeps each Discord batch message reliably under Discord's 2,000-char per-message limit with headroom for speaker labels or timestamps. These thresholds are soft defaults, tunable via `FigureConfig`. DESIGN.md explicitly forbids EMOS MemCell summaries in feed posts; batches use only verbatim segment text.

**Alternatives considered:**
- Fixed N-segment batches: Ignores natural speech cadence. Rejected.
- EMOS MemCell grouping: Explicitly forbidden by DESIGN.md. Rejected.

## 6. Memory URL Shape and Citation Model

**Decision:** Memory URLs follow the pattern `https://www.bibliotalk.space/memory/{emos_user_id}_{timestamp_iso8601}` where `timestamp_iso8601` is the ISO-8601 `create_time` of the segment as returned by EMOS retrieval (the EMOS `timestamp` field). The `Evidence` Pydantic model includes `memory_url`, `memory_user_id`, `memory_timestamp` fields, fully derivable from EMOS retrieval response fields — no extra API call required.

The existing `Citation.index: int` field and citation-index-based validation are removed. `validate_citations` is replaced with `validate_evidence_links` which checks:
1. `memory_user_id == figure.emos_user_id` (cross-figure isolation)
2. The `(memory_user_id, memory_timestamp)` pair appears in the current retrieval result set (not stale from a prior turn)
3. Any `quote_snippet` in the response text is a substring of the corresponding cached `segment.text`

**Rationale:** DESIGN.md specifies inline markdown links as the only citation format (FR-024, FR-025). The `memory_url` is fully constructible from `user_id` + `timestamp` returned by EMOS without a secondary lookup. ISO-8601 timestamps are URL-safe when colons are encoded (or use compact form `20260307T160000Z`).

**Alternatives considered:**
- Separate citation resolution API call per link: Unnecessary round-trip. Rejected.
- Bracketed indices `[1]` + `Sources:` trailing block: Explicitly forbidden by FR-025. Rejected.
