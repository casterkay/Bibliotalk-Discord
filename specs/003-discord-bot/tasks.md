# Tasks: YouTube → EverMemOS → Discord Figure Bots

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/003-discord-bot/`
**Prerequisites**: `plan.md`, `spec.md`, `research.md`, `data-model.md`, `contracts/`, `quickstart.md`

**Tests**: Include unit, contract, and integration tests because the plan and constitution require test coverage for chunking, dedup, citation validation, EverMemOS interactions, page resolution, and critical end-to-end flows.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by phase and then by user story so each story can be implemented and validated independently.

- [ ] T022 Create the Discord bot process bootstrap in `services/discord_service/src/runtime.py` and `services/discord_service/src/__main__.py`
- [ ] T023 [P] Add foundational database and startup tests in `packages/bt_common/tests/test_evidence_store_models.py`, `services/ingestion_service/tests/integration/test_runtime_startup.py`, and `services/discord_service/tests/integration/test_runtime_startup.py`

**Checkpoint**: Shared DB infra, collector runtime, and Discord runtime boundaries are ready for story implementation.

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Ingest a YouTube Channel Into EverMemOS (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP

**Goal**: Discover new YouTube videos for a figure, ingest transcripts into SQLite and EverMemOS, derive transcript batches, and support clean manual re-ingest.

**Independent Test**: Configure one figure with one subscription source, run a poll once, and verify `sources`, `segments`, and `transcript_batches` are created while EverMemOS receives stable `group_id` and `message_id` values. Poll again and confirm the same `video_id` is skipped.

**Checkpoint**: User Story 1 is functional when a single figure can discover, ingest, derive transcript batches, deduplicate, enforce per-source concurrency, and manually re-ingest YouTube videos without any Discord feed or DM chat features enabled.

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Publish Video Feed Into a Discord Channel Thread (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Post one parent feed message and one per-video thread with ordered transcript batches, without duplicate posts on retry.

**Independent Test**: After a successful ingest, run the feed publisher and verify exactly one parent message, one thread, and one ordered set of batch posts are created. Re-run the publisher and verify nothing is duplicated.

- [ ] T046 [US2] Add rate-limit handling and retry logging for Discord publication in `services/discord_service/src/feed/publisher.py`

**Checkpoint**: User Story 2 is functional when the system can publish feed content for already-ingested videos, retry safely, and avoid duplicate threads or messages.

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Grounded DM Chat With a Figure Bot (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Route Discord DMs through a Gemini/ADK figure runtime that retrieves evidence, emits inline memory links, validates links and quotes before sending, and resolves those links through the public memory-page service.

**Independent Test**: DM a figure bot with a question that matches ingested transcript text and verify the response includes at least one valid inline `memory_url` link. Load the linked page and verify it resolves exactly one memory item plus a timestamped source-video link. Ask a question without supporting evidence and verify the explicit no-evidence response.

- [ ] T053 [P] [US3] Adapt EverMemOS retrieval and BM25 reranking to the new evidence shape in `services/agents_service/src/agent/tools/memory_search.py`
- [ ] T054 [P] [US3] Replace citation-index emission with inline `memory_url` emission in `services/agents_service/src/agent/tools/emit_citations.py`
- [ ] T055 [P] [US3] Adapt Gemini agent construction for figure personas and evidence-only responses in `services/agents_service/src/agent/agent_factory.py` and `services/agents_service/src/agent/providers/gemini.py`
- [ ] T056 [US3] Adapt agent orchestration for Discord DM context in `services/agents_service/src/agent/orchestrator.py`
- [ ] T057 [US3] Implement the Discord DM handler in `services/discord_service/src/bot/dm_handler.py`

**Checkpoint**: User Story 3 is functional when a figure bot can answer supported questions with valid inline memory links, linked pages resolve correctly, and unsupported questions are declined without cross-figure leakage.

---

## Phase 6: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Finalize operational readiness, documentation, and full-system validation.

- [ ] T061 [P] Update deployment and local runtime docs in `README.md`, `DESIGN.md`, and `deploy/local/docker-compose.yml`
- [ ] T062 [P] Add developer seed and manual-ingest helper scripts in `services/discord_service/scripts/seed_figure.py` and `services/ingestion_service/scripts/trigger_ingest.py`
- [ ] T063 Add end-to-end quickstart validation coverage in `services/discord_service/tests/integration/test_quickstart_flow.py` and `services/memory_page_service/tests/integration/test_quickstart_memory_pages.py`

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Phase 1: Setup**: No dependencies; start immediately.
- **Phase 2: Foundational**: Depends on Phase 1; blocks all user stories.
- **Phase 3: User Story 1**: Depends on Phase 2; delivers the standalone ingest core.
- **Phase 4: User Story 2**: Depends on Phase 2 and reuses ingested `transcript_batches`; should be built after US1 for a working feed path.
- **Phase 5: User Story 3**: Depends on Phase 2, on US1 producing ingested evidence, and on the memory-page service resolving `memory_url` pages.
- **Phase 6: Polish**: Depends on the user stories selected for delivery.

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: No dependency on other user stories.
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Depends on User Story 1 producing ingested `Source`, `Segment`, and `TranscriptBatch` data in the shared evidence store.
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Depends on User Story 1 producing ingested evidence; does not depend on User Story 2.

### Within Each User Story

- Tests should be written before or alongside implementation and must fail before the feature is considered complete.
- Discovery, models, and library adapters come before orchestration.
- Runtime wiring comes after the lower-level library behavior is proven.
- Integration tests close each story before moving to the next phase.

## Parallel Opportunities

- In **Phase 1**, deletion tasks `T001` to `T007` can be split across contributors because they affect separate directories.
- In **Phase 2**, `T015`, `T016`, `T017`, and `T023` are parallel once the package skeleton exists.
- In **US1**, tests `T024` to `T028` and low-level adapter tasks `T029` to `T031` can run in parallel.
- In **US2**, tests `T037` to `T040` and implementation tasks `T041` and `T042` can run in parallel.
- In **US3**, tests `T047` to `T052` and implementation tasks `T053` to `T055` can run in parallel.

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1 and remove out-of-scope code.
2. Complete Phase 2 and establish the shared database and runtime foundation.
3. Complete Phase 3 and validate ingest, dedup, transcript-batch derivation, manual re-ingest, and per-source concurrency end to end.
4. Stop and verify the P1 ingest workflow before starting feed or DM chat.

### Incremental Delivery

1. Deliver **US1** to prove figure-scoped ingest and evidence persistence.
2. Deliver **US2** to expose ingested videos in Discord threads with idempotent retries.
3. Deliver **US3** to add grounded DM chat and public memory-page resolution on top of the already-proven evidence store.
4. Finish with Phase 6 operational cleanup, deployment wiring, and documentation.

### Suggested MVP Scope

- **Strict MVP cut**: Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 only.
- **Next increment**: Phase 4 for feed publication.
- **Final MVP-complete increment**: Phase 5 for grounded DM chat plus public memory-page resolution.

## Format Validation

- All tasks use the required checklist format: `- [ ] T### [P?] [US?] Description with file path`
- Setup and Foundational tasks intentionally omit story labels.
- User story tasks all include `[US1]`, `[US2]`, or `[US3]`.
- Every task description includes at least one concrete file path.
