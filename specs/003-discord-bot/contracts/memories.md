# Contract: Public Memory Pages

**Feature**: `/Users/tcai/Projects/Bibliotalk/specs/003-discord-bot/spec.md`
**Created**: 2026-03-07
**Scope**: Resolve one public memory page for one EverMemOS MemCell (`memory_id`)

This contract defines the request and response shape for the unified Memories API HTML page used by DM citations.

## Route

- Method: `GET`
- Path: `/memories/{memory_id}`

Where:
- `memory_id = {agent-slug}_{timestamp}`
- `agent_slug` is the agent slug (EverMemOS `user_id`)
- `timestamp` is a compact UTC timestamp (`YYYYMMDDTHHMMSSZ`) matching the MemCell's `timestamp`

## Resolution Rules

1. Parse `memory_id` into `agent-slug` and `timestamp`.
2. Resolve the matching MemCell from EverMemOS (scoped by `user_id=agent_slug` and exact timestamp).
3. Resolve the MemCell's `group_id` (EverMemOS group identifier; stored locally as `sources.emos_group_id`) and load the matching local `Source`.
4. Load the full ordered chunk/segment sequence for the source from SQLite, then use EverMemOS cell timestamps as boundaries to obtain the chunk(s) corresponding to this MemCell.
5. Render exactly one page containing:
   - the agent slug
   - the single MemCell payload returned by EverMemOS
   - the corresponding local excerpt(s) (chunks/segments)
   - a link to the original source at the reconstructed timepoint when applicable (e.g. YouTube `t=...s`)
6. Return `404` when the MemCell cannot be resolved.

## Response Requirements

- The page MUST correspond to exactly one memory item.
- The page MUST NOT include unrelated memories or broader navigation chrome.
- The page MUST include a link to the original source timepoint when applicable.
- The page MUST be publicly readable without Discord authentication.

## Failure Modes

- Invalid `memory_id` → `400`
- Memory not found → `404`
- EverMemOS unavailable → `503`
- Local source/segment lookup failure after valid memory lookup → `500` with structured logging
