# Specification Quality Checklist: YouTube → EverMemOS → Discord Figure Bots

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-03-07
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Specification is derived directly from DESIGN.md and covers all three runtime packages: ingestion, agent runtime, and Discord runtime.
- The memory page serverless worker (`bibliotalk.space/memory/`) is explicitly noted as out-of-scope for this feature branch.
- Technology references (`yt-dlp`, `discord.py`, Gemini/ADK, EverMemOS, SQLite) appear only in the Assumptions section where necessary to bound scope — they do not appear in functional requirements or success criteria.
