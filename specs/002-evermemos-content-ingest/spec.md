# Feature Specification: EverMemOS Content Ingestion

**Feature Branch**: `[002-evermemos-content-ingest]`
**Created**: 2026-03-01
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Create a standalone ingestion package to load curated content into EverMemOS (per BLUEPRINT.md and ROSTER.md), without any interactive web crawling."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Ingest A Single Source For A Spirit (Priority: P1)

As a curator or operator, I can ingest a single content source (for example: a book, an essay, or a time-coded transcript) into EverMemOS for a specific person/figure, so that the Spirit can later answer questions grounded in that material with verifiable citations.

**Why this priority**: This is the smallest end-to-end unit of value: one real source becomes usable evidence for grounded conversation.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by ingesting one source and verifying (a) content is retrievable from EverMemOS for that person/figure and (b) each citation can be traced back to an exact verbatim segment with correct source attribution.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** valid EverMemOS credentials and a single source with title and canonical link, **When** ingestion runs, **Then** the source’s content is stored in EverMemOS as a set of ordered segments grouped under that source and ingestion reports success.
2. **Given** a source whose content cannot be parsed or segmented, **When** ingestion runs, **Then** no partial or misleading ingestion result is reported as “successful”, and the failure includes a human-actionable reason.
3. **Given** a source that cannot be ingested without interactive browsing or dynamic page interaction, **When** ingestion runs, **Then** ingestion fails for that source with an actionable message and does not store partial content.
4. **Given** invalid EverMemOS credentials, **When** ingestion runs, **Then** ingestion fails safely and the reported error contains no secrets.

### User Story 2 - Safe Re-Run Without Duplicates (Priority: P2)

As an operator, I can re-run ingestion for a previously ingested source to either (a) confirm it is already ingested or (b) apply updates, without creating duplicate segments or breaking citation traceability.

**Why this priority**: Ingestion will be run repeatedly (retries, scheduled refreshes, updated sources). Duplicates degrade retrieval quality and citation trust.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by ingesting the same source twice and confirming that EverMemOS content and citation traceability remain stable (no duplicate segments; updates only when content changes).

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a source already ingested with unchanged content, **When** ingestion runs again, **Then** it completes without creating duplicate stored segments and reports “no changes” (or equivalent).
2. **Given** a source already ingested but with updated content, **When** ingestion runs again, **Then** only the changed portions are reflected in storage and the report clearly indicates what changed.

### User Story 3 - Batch Ingest From A Curated Roster (Priority: P3)

As a curator, I can ingest a curated roster of sources for multiple people/figures (for example: a reading list plus public talks/transcripts) in a single batch run, and receive a clear per-source success/failure report.

**Why this priority**: The system’s value grows with breadth of high-quality sources. Batch ingestion reduces operational overhead and makes it feasible to ingest a roster like the one maintained for Bibliotalk figures.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running ingestion on a small roster (3–5 sources) and validating that each item either ingests successfully or fails with actionable errors, without blocking the whole batch.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a roster containing multiple sources across one or more figures, **When** batch ingestion runs, **Then** each source produces an independent status outcome and the overall run produces a consolidated report.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when EverMemOS is temporarily unavailable during ingestion (network outage or service error)?
- What happens when credentials are invalid, expired, or not authorized for the target person/figure?
- How does the system handle extremely large sources (very long books, multi-hour transcripts)?
- How does the system handle content with mixed languages or unusual encodings?
- What happens when a source URL exists but content retrieval requires interactive browsing, authentication, or dynamic page interaction?
- How does the system handle partial failures in a batch (one source fails mid-run)?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST support ingesting content provided directly by an operator (for example: pasted text, uploaded documents, or exported transcripts).
- **FR-002**: System MUST support ingesting time-coded transcripts (when available) while preserving enough “location” context to produce precise citations (for example: timestamps or section markers).
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow operators to associate each ingestion with (a) the person/figure whose memory is being populated and (b) the source identity (title and canonical link).
- **FR-004**: System MUST segment each source into ordered, citation-friendly chunks and store those chunks in EverMemOS under a single source grouping so retrieval can use cross-segment context.
- **FR-005**: System MUST attach source-level metadata in EverMemOS sufficient to support later citation rendering (at minimum: source title and canonical link; optionally: author/publisher/date when provided).
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide an ingestion report for each run that includes per-source status, counts of stored segments, and error details where relevant.
- **FR-007**: System MUST be safe to re-run for the same source without creating duplicate stored content, and MUST clearly report whether content was newly added, unchanged, or updated.
- **FR-008**: System MUST support batch ingestion of multiple sources and MUST continue processing remaining sources when individual sources fail.
- **FR-009**: System MUST NOT use interactive web browsing or automated page interaction to obtain content; if a source cannot be ingested without such interaction, the system MUST fail that source with an explicit, actionable message. Non-interactive HTTP fetching + static extraction (for example, `trafilatura`) is allowed.
- **FR-010**: System MUST protect secrets and sensitive configuration: it MUST NOT write credentials into logs, error messages, or ingestion reports.
- **FR-011**: System MUST preserve verbatim ingested text such that later citation verification can confirm that cited quotes are exact substrings of the original ingested segments.

### Acceptance Coverage

- **FR-001–FR-006, FR-009–FR-011**: Demonstrated by User Story 1 acceptance scenarios and the independent citation-verification test.
- **FR-007**: Demonstrated by User Story 2 acceptance scenarios.
- **FR-008**: Demonstrated by User Story 3 acceptance scenario.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Person/Figure**: The identity whose EverMemOS memory is being populated; used to scope retrieval and grounding.
- **Source**: A single upstream content item (for example: one book, one talk transcript, one podcast episode transcript) with canonical attribution metadata.
- **Segment**: A verbatim chunk of a source with ordering and optional location markers (timestamps/section markers) used for citations.
- **Ingestion Run**: One execution attempt that processes one or more sources and yields a consolidated report with per-source outcomes.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: For a batch of 50 curated sources, at least 95% complete ingestion successfully on the first run (no manual intervention beyond providing credentials and source content/metadata).
- **SC-002**: Re-running ingestion for an unchanged batch of 50 previously ingested sources results in 0 duplicate stored segments and completes with a “no changes” outcome for at least 95% of sources.
- **SC-003**: In a validation set of 100 cited claims generated by Spirits from ingested material, at least 90% of citations resolve to a verifiable verbatim segment with correct source attribution (title + canonical link + location when available).
- **SC-004**: For failed sources, operators can determine the cause and next corrective action from the ingestion report in under 5 minutes per failed source.

## Scope

This feature covers ingesting curated, consented content into EverMemOS to support grounded Spirit conversations with citations. It focuses on transforming operator-provided content into well-attributed, deduplicated, citation-friendly stored memory.

## Out of Scope

- Automated interactive browsing, account login flows, or dynamic page interaction to obtain content.
- Social media ingestion and general-purpose, unbounded web crawling.
- Billing, token metering, or user-facing pricing.
- Spirit response generation, retrieval prompting strategies, or citation rendering in chat clients (only ingestion prerequisites).

## Assumptions

- Operators can obtain the content artifacts to ingest (documents or transcripts) through lawful and appropriate means and provide canonical attribution metadata.
- EverMemOS supports storing segmented content under a source grouping and supports later retrieval for grounded answering.
- The ingestion component will be used by other services or operators; it does not need to be a full end-user product UI.

## Dependencies

- Availability and access to EverMemOS for the relevant person/figure (credentials and authorization).
- Access to canonical source metadata (at minimum: title and canonical link).
