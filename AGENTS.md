# Bibliotalk Development Guidelines

## Coding Assistant Guidelines

- You are a top-tier designer and engineer. Excellence is in your blood. Mediocre work is unacceptable. Exert your highest intellectual and aesthetic capabilities in this project.
- Your technical competency should at least match a Google L8 engineer with over $1M package.
- Always put things in their right places! Use your common sense and artistic taste.
- Always maintain excellent abstraction design: modularity, generality, reusability, separation of concerns, elimination of abstraction leaks, etc.
- Focus on my true intent instead of always literally following my words. If you are confident, you can propose alternatives or raise opposition before executing my commands.
- Choose the latest suitable modern designs in both backend and frontend.
- After you make edits, think and suggest updates to maintain consistency and integrity throughout docs and code. In particular, ensure dev context files including `AGENTS.md` are up to date and have full coverage.
- When you find unexpected changes in code diverted from your read & write memory, always assume they are made by me and RESPECT them.
- Reduction over Multiplication: always consider lossless reduction of code or specs and avoid unnecessary multiplication.
- Adhere to the DRY principle: always seek opportunities to avoid obvious code duplication by extracting common logic into reusable code.

**NOTE:** Read `CODEBASE.txt` for the current codebase structure.

## Active Technologies
- Python 3.11+ (backend services), Node.js 20+ (Matrix voice sidecar) + `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `httpx`, `pydantic>=2`, `SQLAlchemy>=2`, `aiosqlite`, `alembic`, `tenacity`, EverMemOS SDK (`bt_common.evermemos_client`), Gemini via ADK (text) and Gemini Live (voice), `matrix-js-sdk`, `ws` (001-matrix-mvp)
- SQLite for local development; Postgres for production; one logical relational schema shared by ingestion + agent + Matrix adapter (001-matrix-mvp)

- Python 3.11+
- EverMemOS: `evermemos` SDK + `httpx` + `tenacity`
- Ingestion: `youtube-transcript-api`, `yt-dlp`, `typer`, `rich`, SQLite
- Discord: `discord.py` (text-only bot + thread posting)
- Data/modeling: `pydantic`

## Commands

- Sync deps (workspace):
  - `UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/uv-cache uv sync --all-packages --all-extras`
- Run tests (run from each package directory to avoid pytest root collisions):
  - `uv --directory services/discord_service run --package discord_service -m pytest`
  - `uv --directory services/memory_page_service run --package memory_page_service -m pytest`
  - `uv --directory services/ingestion_service run --package ingestion_service -m pytest`
  - `uv --directory packages/bt_common run --package bt_common -m pytest`
- Unified CLI help:
  - `uv run --package bt_cli bibliotalk --help`
- Run runtimes:
  - `uv run --package bt_cli bibliotalk collector run --help`
  - `uv run --package bt_cli bibliotalk discord run --help`
  - `uv run --package bt_cli bibliotalk memory-pages run --help`
- Seed figure/local mapping:
  - `uv run --package bt_cli bibliotalk figure seed --help`
- Trigger manual one-shot ingest:
  - `uv run --package bt_cli bibliotalk ingest request --help`
- Publish pending Discord feeds (without restarting bot):
  - `uv run --package bt_cli bibliotalk feed publish --help`

## Code Style

Python 3.11+: Follow standard conventions

## Recent Changes
- 001-matrix-mvp: Added Python 3.11+ (backend services), Node.js 20+ (Matrix voice sidecar) + `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `httpx`, `pydantic>=2`, `SQLAlchemy>=2`, `aiosqlite`, `alembic`, `tenacity`, EverMemOS SDK (`bt_common.evermemos_client`), Gemini via ADK (text) and Gemini Live (voice), `matrix-js-sdk`, `ws`

- This repository is being repurposed toward a YouTube → EverMemOS → Discord figure-bot pipeline.

## Manual Notes

### Architecture Boundaries

- Treat current repository file layout as the source of truth for imports and ownership.
- `bt_common` is infra-only (`evermemos_client`, `config`, `logging`, `exceptions`). Do not put agent-domain models here.
- The ingestion pipeline (YouTube transcript fetch + chunking + dedup + memorize) lives in `services/ingestion_service/`.

### ingestion_service

- Standalone EverMemOS ingestion library + CLI (see `specs/002-evermemos-content-ingest/`).
- Local artifacts (gitignored): `.ingestion_service/` (SQLite index + JSON reports).

### Common Commands

- Sync deps (workspace; installs all Python members):
  - `UV_CACHE_DIR=/tmp/uv-cache uv sync --all-packages --all-extras`
- Run tests:
  - `uv --directory services/ingestion_service run --package ingestion_service -m pytest`
  - `uv --directory packages/bt_common run --package bt_common -m pytest`
- Ingestion CLI help:
  - `uv run --package bt_cli bibliotalk collector run --help`
